**PURPOSE OF STUDY**

Examined reasons behind prevalent Cholera infections in Kisumu.
To determine the most common mode of transmission among this population and factors contributing to the spread of the disease within Kisumu.

**Outcome**

Leveraged Python for data analysis and employed statistical concepts to carry out Hypothesis Testing and in establishing relationships/patterns :FishersExact,Chi-square,respectively.

From the analysis,these Cholera cases were directly attritubed to use of unclean water,making it unsafe for consumption.Out of those clinically confirmed to have the disease, 50 % of them relied on shallow well water for consumption (borehole) while 10 % we not aware of the source of their water. 30 % were using tap water while 10% claimed to be using spring water for consumption.

However,on local terms, tap water could be interpreted as harvested rain water while for 'spring' water could be river water assumed to be coming from an uphill spring. This is due to the existing situation of poor clean water supply from the County Governement.The water infracsture is hampered with leaking ,clogged water pipes sometimes navigating tough undecent dwellerships.

On the other hand,of those confirmed to have the disease, 90 % of them reported to not using any water treatment in their water while 10 % of them were not aware if they have used or have ever used any treatment in their water.

Fishers Exact test confirmed that the situation is worrrysome.With an established  p value of 0.011 < 0.05,confirmed that there is a strong relatonship lab dignosis and water treatment avaliblity/usability. 

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

1.	That the County government should ensure continuous health education on water treatment.

2.	That the County Governemnt implementats proper sanitation measures such as sewage treatment and waste management.

3.	That the County Government invests in upgrading and maintaining water supply systems.
