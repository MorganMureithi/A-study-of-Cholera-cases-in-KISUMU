**PURPOSE OF STUDY**

To find out causes of Cholera cases in Kisumu County.
Kisumu county is among the few counties that report high infections of Cholera cases and is usually under the radar of Kenya's Ministry of Health.

**METHODOLOGY**

The study involved combing through literature materials on Cholera infections in Kenya.From MOHpublications,IFRC reports,Africa CDC data dump on the infections
and WHO research publications on this disease.
The purpose of this literature search,is to gain deep and wide understanding of the disease from infections,spread and prevalence.

For purposes of this study,we mapped out 3 research objectives to guide our study.Namely:
1.The location of those infected with Cholera

2.The symptoms they exhibited

3.What was the most common method of transmission 

4.aht influnced the outbreak of the vrius,i.e a look into the sanitation methods of confirmed cases.


The data for analysis was secondary data produceraly shared by Kisumu County Dpertment of Health of patients who ehibite cholera-like sysmptoms for investigations.
(Sesitive infromation was removed,inorder to protect patients identities)

The data was inspected,carefully and needfuly cleaned in Excel and afterwards imported into Python for further inspection and analysis.
The reason for this is to protect sensitive and as preferred all information for inference and determination purposes.
The data was exhasutivey warngled in Python,in order to find patterns and relationships within the dataset.

**Outcome**

The study had a sample of 58 patients based on the shared data ,with observations across  33 paramters e.g Sex,Age,Location
Of these 58 patients who were reocrdedd for Cholera-like sympetoms on 10,we clinically established to have Cholera ( confirmation 
of virbrio cholerae in stool).


**LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY**
1.A considerable amount of patient records were missing.These information could not be assussmed as not present as they were initially not stated.therefore,no assumptions could be made over these fields.

2.The sample size was small.A bigger n , could have allowed better 'diagnosis into the matter' and better intervention measures to be proposed.
